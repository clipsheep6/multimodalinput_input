/**
 * Defines touch events and mapped standard events.
 *
 * <p>Information about a touch event includes the finger positions in
 * multi-finger touch, touch pressure, and touch radius. A standard event
 * is used to indicate the user intent. Its definition is irrelevant of the
 * input device type.The system maps a basic interaction event of another type
 * of input to a standard interaction event of a touch input.The mapping is as
 * follows:
 * <b>For basic mouse interaction events:</b>
 * <ul><li>Clicking and holding the left button on the mouse maps to touching
 * the screen with a finger at the pointer
 * position, as described in {@link #PRIMARY_POINT_DOWN}.</li>
 * <li>Clicking and holding the left button on the mouse and then moving the
 * pointer maps to touching the screen and
 * moving the finger on the screen, as described in {@link #POINT_MOVE}.</li>
 * <li>Releasing the left button on the mouse maps to lifting up a finger from
 * the screen, as described in
 * {@link #PRIMARY_POINT_UP}.</li></ul>
 * Note: The touchscreen does not have a hover pointer state. Therefore, if the
 * mouse is moved without any button
 * pressed, no interaction event is mapped to the touchscreen. To map to this
 * mouse input event, this class defines the
 * hover states for the pointer, such as {@link #HOVER_POINTER_ENTER},
 * {@link #HOVER_POINTER_MOVE}, and {@link #HOVER_POINTER_EXIT}.
 * <b>For basic stylus interaction events:</b>
 * <ul><li>Touching the screen with the stylus pen tip maps to touching the
 * screen with a finger, as described in {@link #PRIMARY_POINT_DOWN}.</li>
 * <li>Touching the screen with the stylus pen tip and then moving on the screen
 * maps to touching the screen and moving
 * the finger on the screen, as described in {@link #POINT_MOVE}.</li>
 * <li>Lifting up the stylus from the screen maps to lifting up a finger from
 * the screen, as described in{@link #PRIMARY_POINT_UP}.</li></ul>
